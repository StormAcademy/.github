### ❔ Updates and release date
Updates and news can be found inside of our Twitter, Instagram and inside our Discord Server.
Our current planned release date is dated to June 3rd at 12 P.M. (UTC/GMT).

## ℹ️ How will it work?
There will be multiples ways to learn how to code inside of our website, users will be able to complete simple exercices that are organized by levels (beginner/intermidiate/expert/professional), each one will be divided by multiple sections that can contain sheets, and courses.

### ❔ Does completing exercices and sheets give anything?
Yes, it does.
Completing an exercise or sheet in the shortest time will let you enjoy more well deserved points.

#### ❓ What are points?
Points given to the user after sucefully completing an exercicse, or sheet will let them buy a Course using points, instead of real money.
Obviously, you will need to complete multiple sheets in order to be able to purchase a course for free, using only points, but you will be able to enjoy a discount as well, such as 20% or 50% if you do not have enough points to buy it with a 100% discount.
