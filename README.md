# StørmAcademy
## Information
StørmAcademy is an upcoming coding platform.
This project will provide multiple ways to code will consist in an online code editor where the client/user can edit the syntax given in an exercise, or in a course.

## Points
There will be a point system which will work the following way:
- The user will receive a certain ammount of points based on the task they complete, for example:
  - If the user completes a simple Ruby exercise _(which takes about 5 minutes to complete)_, they will be given 2 points.
  - If the user completes a whole Ruby exercise sheet _(should take about an hour and a half to complete)_, they will be given 100 points.

In case the user completes a whole section of exercises, the ammount of points will be different, since it will based on how long it took.

### What do points do?
Points only work as a _"storm currency"_, which we would like to call the **Stormies**.
For those who can't afford a course, points come in.. but how will this work exactly?
 Courses will have 2 options as a payment:
  - Mastercard or Debit Card;
  - Points.

_*But how am I gonna buy a course with points?*_
Buying a course with points, is gonna take a really big ammount of time, since you'll need atleast 1000 points to buy a course using points.

## Currency
Our currency, **Stormies**, will be built in C++.
This will work as a way to improve the experience to all our users and to create a funnier way to learn code.

### Why C++ though?
C++ can help us get into the Crypto market, which we are thinking of adding an option to convert points to crypto.

#### How much will 1 point be in crypto?
Well, 1 single point will only be about 0.00001.
